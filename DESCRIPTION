Title: Estimate Anaerobic Threshold From A Treadmill Stepwise Fitness Test
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Who wrote it
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: This package is for analyzing data from a treadmill fitness test
    where speed is augmented by a constant amount every set number of seconds, to 
    estimate the anaerobic (lactate) threshold speed and heart rate. It reads a tcx 
    file, allows optional removal observations from before and after the actual test,
    fits a change-point linear model where the change-point is the estimate of 
    the lactate threshold, and plots the data points and fit model.
