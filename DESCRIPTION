Type: Package
Title: Conconi et al. Estimate of Anaerobic Threshold from a TCX File
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Levi Waldron
Maintainer: Levi Waldron <lwaldron.research@gmail.com>
Description: Analyzes data from a Conconi et al. treadmill fitness test where 
    speed is augmented by a constant amount every set number of seconds to 
    estimate the anaerobic (lactate) threshold speed and heart rate. It reads a TCX 
    file, allows optional removal observations from before and after the actual test,
    fits a change-point linear model where the change-point is the estimate of 
    the lactate threshold, and plots the data points and fit model. Details of 
    administering the fitness test are provided in the package vignette. Functions
    work by default for Garmin Connect TCX exports but may require additional 
    data preparation for heart rate, time, and speed data from other sources.
