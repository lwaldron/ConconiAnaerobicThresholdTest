Title: Conconi et al. Estimate of Anaerobic Threshold from Garmin TCX File
Version: 0.1.2
Author: Levi Waldron
Maintainer: Levi Waldron <levi.waldron@sph.cuny.edu>
Description: Analyzes data from a Conconi et al. treadmill fitness test where 
    speed is augmented by a constant amount every set number of seconds to 
    estimate the anaerobic (lactate) threshold speed and heart rate. It reads a tcx 
    file, allows optional removal observations from before and after the actual test,
    fits a change-point linear model where the change-point is the estimate of 
    the lactate threshold, and plots the data points and fit model. Details of 
    administering the fitness test are provided in the package vignette.
