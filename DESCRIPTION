Title: Estimate Anaerobic Threshold from a Treadmill Stepwise Fitness Test
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Levi Waldron
Maintainer: Levi Waldron <levi.waldron@sph.cuny.edu>
Description: Analyzes data from a treadmill fitness test where speed is 
    augmented by a constant amount every set number of seconds, to 
    estimate the anaerobic (lactate) threshold speed and heart rate. It reads a tcx 
    file, allows optional removal observations from before and after the actual test,
    fits a change-point linear model where the change-point is the estimate of 
    the lactate threshold, and plots the data points and fit model. Details of 
    administering the fitness test are provided in the package vignette.
