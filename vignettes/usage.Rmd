# Performing the test

Use a chest strap heart rate monitor if available.

1.  set the treadmill to 1% incline to compensate for lack of wind resistance
2.  warm up by jogging on the treadmill at a slow speed for 10 minutes
3.  rest for 10 minutes with light static or dynamic stretching
4.  start at a low speed where you can still jog, not run, and have several steps before you hit your anaerobic threshold. 6km/h is a likely choice. km/h is likely better than mph for the smaller steps in speed.
5.  spend 90 seconds at each speed. After 90 seconds, increase the speed by 1 km/h
6.  continue until exhaustion, when you can no longer maintain the speed. The test ends and the end of the last segment where the full 90 seconds are completed.

At the end of the test, you can remain still for several minutes with the heart rate monitor still recording, to separately measure and compare rate of recovery. Analysis of heart rate recovery isn't currently handled by this package however.

# How to figure out startminutes and endminutes

Useful in case the run was started before the start of the actual step test, or ended after.

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(TreadmillFitnessTest)
```

```{r}
fname = system.file("extdata/2023-01-16.tcx", package = "TreadmillFitnessTest")
tmp <- prepdata(fname, startminutes = 0, endminutes = 100,
          useDeviceSpeed = TRUE)
plot(tmp$minutes, tmp$speed)
plot(tmp$minutes, tmp$cadence_running)
plot(tmp$minutes, tmp$heart_rate)
```

By iteratively adjusting the `startminutes` and `endminutes` and replotting, or just replotting with adjusted axes, I found that the correct start time was at 0.15 minutes and correct end time at 15 minutes.

# January 2023 test

Import the data and show the same plots.

```{r}
dat202301 <- prepdata(fname, startminutes = 0.15, endminutes = 15,
          useDeviceSpeed = FALSE)
(dat202301$date = substr(dat202301$time[1], 1, 10))
```

```{r}
plot(dat202301$minutes, dat202301$speed)
plot(dat202301$minutes, dat202301$cadence_running)
plot(dat202301$minutes, dat202301$heart_rate)
```

## Model fitting

This model uses all available data points:

```{r}
fitmodel(dat202301, alldata = TRUE)
```

And this model uses only the final 5 measurements in each step:

```{r}
fitmodel(dat202301, alldata = FALSE)
```

# Sept 15, 2023 test

```{r}
fname = system.file("extdata/2023-09-15.tcx", package = "TreadmillFitnessTest")
dat202309 <- prepdata(fname, startminutes = 23.8, endminutes = 40.1,
          useDeviceSpeed = FALSE)
dat202309$date = substr(dat202309$time[1], 1, 10)
with(dat202309, plot(minutes, speed))
```

## Model fitting

```{r}
fitmodel(dat202309, alldata = TRUE)
fitmodel(dat202309, alldata = FALSE)
```

# 2022-23 together

Some plots demonstrating comparison of two tests. First join the two data.frames, and convert date and speed to factors (to make plots appear the way I want them to).

```{r}
xall <- full_join(x=dat202309, y=dat202301) |>
    mutate(date = factor(date)) |>
    mutate(speed = factor(speed))
```

## Boxplot of heart rate vs speed

```{r, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=6.3}
ggplot(xall, aes(x=speed, y=heart_rate, fill = date)) +
    geom_boxplot()  +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(90, 200, by=10))
```

## Scatterplot with Loess smoothing curve for heart rate vs speed

```{r, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=6.3}
ggplot(xall, aes(x = minutes, y = heart_rate, color = date)) +
    geom_point(size = 0.5)  +
    geom_smooth() +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(90, 200, by = 10), name = "Heart Rate (bpm)") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 16.5, by = 1.5), name = "Time (minutes)", 
                       sec.axis = sec_axis( ~ . / 1.5 + 6, 
                                            name = "speed (km/h)", 
                                            breaks = seq(6, 16, by = 1)))
```

## Scatterplot with Loess smoothing curve for running cadence vs speed

```{r, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=6.3}
ggplot(xall, aes(x = minutes, y = 2 * cadence_running, color = date)) +
    geom_point(size = 0.5)  +
    geom_smooth() +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(150, 200, by = 10), name = "Cadence (spm)") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 16.5, by = 1.5), name = "Time (minutes)", 
                       sec.axis = sec_axis( ~ . / 1.5 + 6, 
                                            name = "speed (km/h)", 
                                            breaks = seq(6, 16, by = 1)))
```
